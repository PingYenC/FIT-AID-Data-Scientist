## **What is your preferred language when building predictive models and why?**
   
  I prefer using Python for building predictive models because it was the first coding language I learned, and it has remained my primary tool.
  
  Throughout my experience, Iâ€™ve worked on various projects in a Python environment:
  * Student Data Analyst at AbbVie:
    - Enhanced pharmaceutical manufacturing plans by 85% using Python for XGBoost predictive modeling with Object-Oriented Programming on medical datasets to identify and predict disease progression patterns.
    - Strengthened individual healthcare plans by 95% through A/B testing on various events in a patient's medical journey utilizing Python for Logistic Regression predictive modeling on specific medical records.
  * Audit Associate (Financial Analysis) at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC):
    - Boosted operation efficiency of a material company by 40% leveraging Python Matplotlib to target high-value inventory, create innovative metrics, and propose actionable solutions for material tracking and delivery.
  * Developed a deep learning neural-network predictive model for diagnosing pathologies from chest X-rays, achieving 91% accuracy, to enhance medical diagnostics and healthcare treatment.
  * Achieved a 96% user satisfaction rate in recipe recommendations by employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including TF-IDF and Count Vectorizer, to analyze users' queries and offer top-related responses.
  * Employed a Random Forest machine learning method to build a predictive model with 96% accuracy in forecasting the winner of the UEFA Champions League.
    The insights were valuable for sports analysts, investment professionals, and marketing teams.
  * Developed a semiconductor stock price prediction model using Python for support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest machine learning, providing investment strategies that could increase profits by 21%.

  In summary, Python remains my preferred language due to its versatility and my extensive experience with it.  

## **Provide an example of when you used SQL to extract data.**

  During my time as a Student Data Analyst at AbbVie, I developed complex SQL queries to filter, classify, and extract data from large-scale OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) datasets.
  
  For instance, I used such functions as:
  
  * "EXTRACT", "BETWEEN", "YEAR()", and "ORDER BY" to preprocess raw medical data;
  * "WHERE" to filter and target the specific patient data for investigation;
  * "INNER JOIN" and "LEFT JOIN" to combine data from different datasets;
  * "GROUP BY" to classify patient data into segments based on the various purposes;
  * "INTO OUTFILE" to export the organized data as an Excel file.

  In short, this experience provided me with extensive working knowledge of utilizing SQL to extract and process large-scale data.
  
## **Give an example of a situation where you disagreed upon an idea or solution design with a co-worker.  How did you handle the case?**

  Back when I worked as a Student Data Analyst at AbbVie, I engaged in a discussion with a co-worker regarding the optimal machine learning algorithms for building predictive models. Our project aimed to predict disease progression, which would ultimately aid in pharmaceutical manufacturing and personalized healthcare plans.
  
  While my co-worker suggested using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network, I proposed using XGBoost and Logistics Regression algorithms. He disagreed with my opinion, arguing that the project was inherently a time series problem.

  To demonstrate the validity of my approach, I conducted a thorough analysis of the project's objectives and presented my findings to him. I explained that the project was not merely a simple time series forecasting task but a combined problem of time series forecasting and A/B testing. I clarified that while LSTM could be applicable, the complexity of the problem warranted the use of robust algorithms like XGBoost and easily interpretable ones like Logistic Regression. This comprehensive reasoning finally convinced him and thus we were able to go on to the next step.

  This experience taught me that the best way to convince people is through well-organized reasoning. It is necessary to dive deeply into the problem and look at the whole picture. Doing so allowed me to come up with persuasive arguments and influence others' opinions.

## **What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses and how will these affect your performance here?**

  My greatest strengths lie in my analytical skills, proficiency with data analysis tools, and my ability to translate complex data into actionable insights.

  I have extensive experience in developing machine learning models and using advanced analytics to solve engineering problems. My academic and professional background has equipped me with a robust understanding of data science, machine learning, and business analytics. Additionally, my bilingual proficiency in English and Mandarin allows me to communicate effectively in cross-cultural environments, which is crucial for collaborative projects with the University of Maryland.

  One of my notable strengths is my ability to adapt and continuously improve. For instance, during my time at PwC, I frequently had to analyze large datasets and present findings in a clear and concise manner to clients, which honed my data visualization and presentation skills. This will be particularly beneficial for constructing analysis platforms and integrating ChatGPT applications in FIT-Foxconn Interconnect Technology.

  Regarding my weaknesses, I initially struggled with multitasking. Early in my career at PwC, I had difficulty managing multiple responsibilities simultaneously. I had to complete a series of e-learning courses while auditing a challenging case for a clothing manufacturing company. My inability to balance these tasks efficiently resulted in overtime work and reliance on colleagues' assistance.

  However, this experience taught me the importance of grouping similar tasks to avoid redundancy and improve efficiency. For example, when tasked with auditing three manufacturing companies simultaneously, I first reviewed the accounting principles related to the manufacturing industry. This preparation allowed me to streamline my workflow and focus on analyzing key financial information, ultimately completing my audits more efficiently.

  Through this, I have significantly improved my multitasking skills. By applying these strategies, I am confident that I can handle the demands of this role, contribute effectively to the development of ML models, and collaborate on engineering solutions. My continuous improvement mindset ensures that I will always strive to enhance my performance and deliver high-quality results for your team.
